Project Description:
This project represents a web application developed using NestJS and Prisma technologies. The application operates in the background with a PostgreSQL database, offering high performance and scalability. Here are the main components of the project:

NestJS: The project is built using the NestJS framework, which is based on Node.js, to develop a web application. NestJS provides a modular and clean structure, making it easy to organize business logic.

Prisma: Prisma ORM is used to simplify database interactions and manage database schemas. Prisma is compatible with TypeScript and enhances database operations.

PostgreSQL: The project utilizes a PostgreSQL database for data storage. PostgreSQL is a powerful and open-source option for relational databases.

The primary goal of this project is to provide users with a RESTful or GraphQL API that enables them to perform specific functionalities. Data reading, writing, updating, and deleting operations on the database are conducted through this API.

The project addresses critical aspects such as security, performance, and scalability, ensuring that users can handle their data securely. Additionally, by taking advantage of NestJS and Prisma's benefits, the code remains clean and easily maintainable.
